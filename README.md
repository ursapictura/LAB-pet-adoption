# Pet Adoption Website

## Project Overview
This is a mobile-friendly web application that allows visitors to see adoptable pets. Pets can be sorted according to species. New pets can be added and adoptable pets can be removed from the website after adoption. Each pet's card includes their name, species, coloration, and personality. 

## User and Problem
This site is designed for rescues to host their adoptable pets in a user friendly way. The ability to convenently search for adoptable pets online will encourage more people to adopt and will also help prmote adoptable pets who may otherwise go unnoticed in shelters.
